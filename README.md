## Setup and Installation

To get this project up and running locally, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) or another MySQL-compatible database (e.g., MariaDB).

---

### 1. Backend Setup

First, set up the Node.js server and connect it to your database.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/product-optimizer.git](https://github.com/your-username/product-optimizer.git)
    cd product-optimizer/backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database:**
    * Log in to your MySQL server and create a new database.
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE product_optimization;
        ```

4.  **Create the environment file:**
    * Create a new file named `.env` in the `backend` directory.
    * Copy the contents of `.env.example` into it and fill in your database credentials and API keys.
        ```env
        # --- Server Configuration ---
        NODE_ENV=development
        PORT=5000

        # --- Database Configuration ---
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_USER=your_db_user
        DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
        DB_NAME=product_optimization

        # --- External API Keys ---
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
        APIFY_API_TOKEN=your_apify_api_token_here

        # --- Frontend URL ---
        FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
        ```

5.  **Run the server:**
    * The database tables will be created automatically when the server starts for the first time.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Steps to Set Up Apify üï∑Ô∏è

1.  **Create an Account**: First, go to the official Apify website ([https://apify.com/](https://apify.com/)) and create an account.

2.  **Go to Settings**: In the left menu, navigate to **"Settings"**. (It's the last item in the menu, so you may need to scroll to the bottom).

3.  **Find Your API Key**: Click on the **API** tab located in the top-right corner. You can create a new `API_KEY` here, but this is optional because a key is automatically generated when you sign up.

4.  **Go to the Apify Store**:
    * Click on **"Apify Store"** (the first item in the left menu).
    * Search for **"Amazon Products & Reviews - canadesk"**. You can also go directly to the page [here](https://console.apify.com/actors/allWTAqnk6LAtZ63v/input).

5.  **Start a Free Trial**: Click on the price dropdown menu and select the option to start a **free trial (1 day)**. This will be enough to test the application.


### 2. Frontend Setup

Next, set up the React client.

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    # From the root project directory
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The React application should now be running and will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## AI Prompts and Reasoning

To ensure high-quality, structured output from the Gemini AI, a specific prompt engineering strategy was used. The AI is given a clear role, a detailed description of the input, and a strict JSON format for the output.

**Reasoning behind the prompt:**

1.  **Role-Playing**: Assigning the role of "an e-commerce optimization expert" puts the AI in the correct context to generate persuasive and relevant content.
2.  **Explicit Instructions**: The prompt clearly outlines the goal (improve conversion rates, maintain accuracy) and provides guidelines for each field (e.g., "Make the title more compelling and SEO-friendly").
3.  **Structured Output**: Requesting a specific JSON format is crucial. It makes the AI's response predictable and easy to parse on the backend, preventing errors and ensuring consistency in the data we store and display.

## Future Improvements üîÆ

If given more time, the following features could be implemented to further enhance the application:

* **User Authentication**: Add user accounts to allow sellers to save and manage their own private list of optimized products.
* **Performance Analytics**: Integrate with Amazon's APIs to track how AI-driven changes affect a product's sales rank, views, and conversion rates over time.
* **A/B Testing**: Allow users to generate multiple optimized versions of a listing and provide tools to help them run A/B tests on Amazon.
* **Support for More Platforms**: Extend the application to support other e-commerce platforms like Shopify, Walmart, or eBay.
* **Batch Processing**: Allow users to upload a CSV file of ASINs to optimize multiple products at once.
